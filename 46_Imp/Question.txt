Create a class Student with below attributes:
id - int
name - String
totmarksobt - int

Note: The total marks obtained is considered for 4
subjects and the maximum marks that one can
score in each subject is 100.

Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.
Create class Solution with main method
Implement two static methods -
findStudentWithhighestTotal and
searchStudentsBypercentage in Solution class.

findStudentWithhighestTotal:
Create a static method findStudentWithhighestTotal in the Solution class. This method will take array of
Student objects as input and returns the Student'sname who has scored the highest total. Display the
student's name in UPPER case format.

searchStudentsBypercentage:
Create a static method searchStudentsBypercentage in the Solution class. This method will take an array of Student objects
and returns the sorted list of students id's(sorted in ascending order ), who have scored more than 70 percent or more if found, else returns null if not
found.

These methods should be called from the main
method.

Write code to perform the following tasks:
1. Take necessary input variable and callfindStudentWithhighestTotal. For this method - The main method should print the Student's name
with highest total(of marks) in upper case.

2. Take necessary input variables and call searchStudentsBypercentage. For this method - The main method should print the Student id's (sorted
in ascending order of the id's) of students who have scored 70 percent or more, if the returned value is not null, or it should print "No Student found with
mentioned attribute." (without the quotes) if returned value is null.

Refer to sample input/output below for better understanding of the format in which Student object needs to be printed in main method if
returned value is not null for above methods. The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method. Also write the code
for accepting the inputs and printing the outputs. Don't use any static test or formatting for printing the result. Just invoke the method and print the result

Note : All String comparison needs to be case in-
sensitive if applicable.

You can use/refer the below given sample input and
output to verify your solution.
